 # **Project title**

Twilight Labyrinth is a 2D roguelike/roguelite survival game that combines elements from "Vampire Survivors" and "Risk of Rain." The game's core mechanic involves navigating through a dynamically generated maze filled with traps, enemies, and environmental hazards, culminating in a boss battle. The game features a day-night cycle, where vampires are stronger at night and more vulnerable during the day.
Players will not need to use specific keys for their attacks, except for their Ultimate ability. Attacks will always be active, firing in the direction of the mouse.

 # **Motivation**

The motivation behind this project stems from a love of the genre. Additionally, it serves as the final project for our Computer Science degrees.

 # **Build status**

The build is currently in development and has not yet reached Alpha testing. By the end of July, players will be able to load in and fight enemies. The true Alpha test is planned for the end of August, with Beta testing scheduled for the end of September.

#  **Code style**
  
The code style we are using is C# built in the Unity6 engine.

 # **Features**
  
What really makes this game different from other games in the genre is the Map and Maze generation. Most if not all the games focus on a player dealing damage, gaining XP, unlocking abilities, dying and repeating. Where this is fun, it can be annoying playing the same thing every time you need to restart. With the maze generation the player will be presented with a new map and new ways to interact with the environment every play through. While the enemies and bosses are the same the way in which you navigate the maze will be ever changing.
